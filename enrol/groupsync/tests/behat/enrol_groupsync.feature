Feature: Cohort membership is one-way synchronised with the group membership
  In order to automatically add cohort members to the course group members
  As a teacher
  I can set up groupsync enrolments

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | student1 | Studie    | One      | student1@example.com |
      | student2 | Studie    | Two      | student2@example.com |
      | student3 | Studie    | Three    | student3@example.com |
