This files describes API changes in /mod/workshop - activity modules,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 2.9 ===

* Introduced support for delegated method calls. In places like `$workshop->delegate->method_name()`, subplugins
  have a chance to intercept the normal code flow and amend the output and/or data processing. To do so, the
  subplugin has to provide a dedicated class <subplugintype>_<subpluginname>_delegate (typically stored in its
  classes/delegate.php file) with selected delegated methods implemented. See MDL-49619 for details.

=== 2.7 ===

* The method workshop::log() has been deprecated in the workshop module. Please use the event classes instead
  (mod/workshop/classes/event).
